I am a lecturer in social sciences at the University of the West of Scotland. I am interested in charitable organisations, in particular where they operate and how they are regulated. I use large-scale administrative data combined with longitudinal and spatial statistical modelling. My teaching interests include foundational and applied topics in quantitative methods, and computational social science techniques (e.g., web scraping). I am a steering group member and teaching lead of the [Sustainable Policy Analysis Research Centre]() and a trustee of the [Voluntary Sector Studies Network](https://www.vssn.org.uk/).
